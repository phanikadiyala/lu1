    /* The delete operator only deletes own properties, not inherited ones. */
    /*A delete expression evaluates to true if the delete succeeded or if the delete had no
     effect (such as deleting a nonexistent property).*/


o = {x:1}; // o has own property x and inherits property toString
delete o.x; // Delete x, and return true
delete o.x; // Do nothing (x doesn't exist), and return true
delete o.toString; // Do nothing (toString isn't an own property), return true
delete 1; // Nonsense, but evaluates to true

/*delete does not remove properties that have a configurable attribute of false. Certain properties of
 built-in objects are nonconfigurable */


delete Object.prototype; // Can't delete; property is non-configurable
var x = 1; // Declare a global variable
delete this.x; // Can't delete this property
function f() {} // Declare a global function
delete this.f; // Can't delete this property either

/*When deleting configurable properties of the global object in non-strict mode, you can
omit the reference to the global object and simply follow the delete operator with the
    property name:*/
        this.x = 1; // Create a configurable global property (no var)
        delete x;    // And delete it
/*In strict mode, however, delete raises a SyntaxError if its operand is an unqualified
identifier like x, and you have to be explicit about the property access:*/

        delete x; // SyntaxError in strict mode
       delete this.x; // This works

    /*Testing Properties--- You can do this with the in operator, with the hasOwnProperty() and
     propertyIsEnumerable() methods, or simply by querying the property.*/

    /*in-It returns true if the object has an own property or an inherited property by
     that name: */
    var o = { x: 1 }
"x" in o; // true: o has an own property "x"
"y" in o; // false: o doesn't have a property "y"
"toString" in o; // true: o inherits a toString property

    /*The hasOwnProperty() method of an object tests whether that object has an own property
     with the given name. It returns false for inherited properties:*/

var o = { x: 1 }
o.hasOwnProperty("x"); // true: o has an own property x
o.hasOwnProperty("y"); // false: o doesn't have a property y
o.hasOwnProperty("toString"); // false: toString is an inherited property

    /* propertyIsEnumerable() ----  It returns true only if
     the named property is an own property and its enumerable attribute is true.*/

//var o = inherit({ y: 2 });
o.x = 1;
o.propertyIsEnumerable("x"); // true: o has an own enumerable property x
o.propertyIsEnumerable("y"); // false: y is inherited, not own
Object.prototype.propertyIsEnumerable("toString"); // false: not enumerable

    /*Instead of using the in operator it is often sufficient to simply query the property and
     use !== to make sure it is not undefined:*/

var o = { x: 1 }
o.x !== undefined; // true: o has a property x

o.y !== undefined; // false: o doesn't have a property y
o.toString !== undefined; // true: o inherits a toString property
/* in--- can distinguish between properties that do not exist and
 properties that exist but have been set to undefined. */

var o = { x: undefined } // Property is explicitly set to undefined
o.x !== undefined // false: property exists but is undefined
o.y !== undefined // false: property doesn't even exist
"x" in o // true: the property exists
"y" in o // false: the property doesn't exists
delete o.x; // Delete the property x
"x" in o // false: it doesn't exist anymore

    /*Note that the code above uses the !== operator instead of !=. !== and === distinguish
     between undefined and null.*/
// If o has a property x whose value is not null or undefined, double it.
if (o.x != null) o.x *= 2;
// If o has a property x whose value does not convert to false, double it.
// If x is undefined, null, false, "", 0, or NaN, leave it alone.
if (o.x) o.x *= 2;


Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor({x:1}, "x");  // Returns {value: 1, writable:true, enumerable:true, configurable:true}
/*To set the attributes of a property, or to create a new property with the specified attributes,
 call Object.defineProperty(), passing the object to be modified, the name of
the property to be created or altered, and the property descriptor object:*/


 var o = {}; // Start with no properties at all
// Add a nonenumerable data property x with value 1.

    writable: true,
    enumerable: false,

 enumerable own properties of an object.*/

     all four attributes. If you’re creating a new property, then omitted attributes are taken
     to be false or undefined. If you’re modifying an existing property, then the attributes
     you omit are simply left unchanged. Note that this method alters an existing own
     property or creates a new own property, but it will not alter an inherited property.*/

/*The object literal syntax for accessor properties described in §6.6 allows us to define
 accessor properties in new objects, but it doesn’t allow us to query the getter and setter
 methods or to add new accessor properties to existing objects.*/

/*Every object has associated prototype, class, and extensible attributes.*/

/* An object’s prototype attribute specifies the object from which it inherits properties.*/

/*The prototype attribute is set when an object is created. Recall from §6.1.3 that objects
 created from object literals use Object.prototype as their prototype. Objects created
 with new use the value of the prototype property of their constructor function as their
 prototype. And objects created with Object.create() use the first argument to that
 function (which may be null) as their prototype.*/

 object.*/

/* Objects created through built-in constructors such as Array and Date
 have class attributes that match the names of their constructors*/

/*Object.seal() works like Object.preventExtensions(), but in addition to making the
 object nonextensible, it also makes all of the own properties of that object nonconfigurable.

 still be set, however. There is no way to unseal a sealed object. You can use
 Object.isSealed() to determine whether an object is sealed. */

 prevents existing properties from being removed; and prevents existing properties,
